## Recommendations

This repo works best in vscode/forks with the ESLint, Prettier, and Typescript extensions installed and enabled!

## Getting started

You can get this template now in your terminal by running
```bash
npx degit imkunet/solidjs-template my-project
```
and then inside the project directory run
```bash
pnpm i
```

## Customization

Some things you might want to remember to change to your
own and or re-brand are:

- Project license
- `package.json` name and version
- `index.html` title, meta, and theme colors
- `src/assets/favicon.ico`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `pnpm dev` or `pnpm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

### `pnpm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

You can deploy the `dist` folder to any static host provider (pages.dev, vercel, netlify, etc.)
